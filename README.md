ADES C++ implementation
----

Depends on :
 - mlpack [http://www.mlpack.org/]
 - libgp [https://github.com/mblum/libgp]

## Quick-start

This library implements in C++ the ADES model and related tools. Documentation can be generated by:

```
doxygen adesdoc_built.config
```

Some examples can be found in the examples folder and will be compiled when building. They demonstrate basic usage of the library. A ROS wrapper is temporary available [here](https://github.com/r1d1/iis_libades_ros) for easy integration with robot software.
