ADES C++ implementation
----

Depends on :
 - mlpack [http://www.mlpack.org/]
 - libgp [https://github.com/mblum/libgp]
 - boost serialization [http://www.boost.org/]

## Quick-start

This library implements in C++ the ADES model and related tools. Documentation can be generated by:

```
doxygen adesdoc_built.config
```

## Building

This library relies on CMake for build ; thus, building only requires the usual following commands (in the library folder):

```
mkdir build && cd build

cmake ..

make (-j4)

sudo make install
```

Files will be installed in ```/usr/lib``` and ```/usr/include```, and are assumed to be there when searched by the ROS node (see below). Consider updating these path if you follow a different organisation.

Some examples can be found in the examples folder and will be compiled when building. They demonstrate basic usage of the library. A ROS wrapper is temporary available [here](https://github.com/r1d1/iis_libades_ros) for easy integration with robot software. It provides some services to interact with the ADES database and ADES data structures. The intented use of this library is through the node, but if you develop a different interface, we'll be happy to know about.
